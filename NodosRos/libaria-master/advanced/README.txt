This directory has various advanced demo applications, they are largely 
undocumented, but do some cool things. It also contains some examples 
using more obscure or less-used features or devices.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

actsDemo - This one picks up a block (channel 2) and carrys it back and forth
between two placards (channels 1 and 3) 

actsDemoSimple - Like the above but it picks up a block (channel 2) and simply
takes it to a placard (channel 1) then stops

condition - Example of how to use a condition variable (threading)

joydriveUserControl - A normal joydrive program, but where control remains in
the users hands instead of ARIAs

peoplebotDemo - Picks up a block (channel 2) from a table and takes it back 
and forth between two placards also sitting on tables (channels 1 and 3)

amptuDemo - Demo of the old AMPTU device.

sickSpinLogger, sickSquareLogger, sickAutoLogger - Variations of the sickLogger
example that drive the robot automatically rather than using user joystick
