<h2>
<a NAME="Sounds_dir"></a>Sounds Directory &amp; Browse</h2>
The <b>Sounds Directory</b> text entry box lets you type in a path, or
use the <b>Browse...</b> button to bring up a dialog that lets you select
the directory where you've stored your recorded ".wav", ".au", and other
sound files on disk. The <b>Choose Dir</b> button below the Sound Files
window does the same thing, too. Sound Files are the original recorded
sounds and sound effects that you will use to assemble an edit an ActivMedia
Sound file (AMS) for download to your Amigo<font size=-1>BOT </font>robot.
The sound file contents of the Sounds Directory appear in the <b>Sounds</b>
window.
<p>Click in the text box at the place in the text where you want to start
typing a new Sounds directory path. Double-click to select and overwrite
the entire directory pathname. Use the right and left arrow keys to step
over typed letters, or press the <b>Backspace</b> or <b>Delete</b> key
to remove letters from the text.
<p>See also <i><a href="File.html#Choose Sounds">Choose Sounds Directory</a></i>
from the <b>File</b> menu.
<h2>
<a NAME="Available"></a>Available Time</h2>
The <b>Available Time</b> segment of the AmigoSounds main window tells
you how much of the available sound playback time your AMS-assembled sounds
would take up when downloaded to your AmigoBot. The
available time is presented as a numeric percentage of the total 70 seconds
(1 megabyte of data at 9 KHz playback), as a thermometer-like visual indicator,
and as actual time in seconds. You will not be able to add a sound to the
AMS file if, by its addition, the total length exceeds that available on
AmigoBot. Remove other sounds to make room for the
new sound, or shorten the original sound to fit.
<h2>
<a NAME="Sounds Window"></a>Sound Files Window, Play Sound, and Choose
Dir</h2>
The <b>Sound Files</b> window on the left side of AmigoSounds contains
the names of the recorded .wav", ".au", and other sound files that you
have stored on disk in the selected <i><a href="#Sounds_Dir">Sounds Directory</a></i>.
Click the <b>Choose Dir</b> button just below the window, or select the
<i><a href="File.html#Choose Sounds">Choose
Sounds Directory</a></i> item from the <b>File</b> menu to load your original
sound files into the Sound Files window.
<p>If you have enabled <i><a href="Settings.html#Lengths">Show Sound Lengths</a></i>
in your <i><a href="Settings.html#Preferences">Preferences</a></i>, AmigoSounds
will calculate and display each sound file's playing time, in seconds.
Use these times to estimate how the sound will impact the <i><a href="#Available">Available
Time</a></i> if added to the AMS for download to AmigoBot.
Please be patient: time calculations take a while to complete, during which
AmigoSounds will not be available for other operations. Also, the Microsoft
Windows(R) version of an accessory program, SOX, may encounter errors during
sound file transfer. If this occurs, simply <b>Close</b> the error dialog
and continue operation, although you may have to translate the particular
sound file into a different format using another sound tool (such as Sound
Recorder) to add the sound to your AMS.
<p>Click a sound name (highlight the line), then click the <b>Play Sound</b>
button directly beneath the Sounds window to play the sound through your
PC's audio system (sound card required). Click the sound file name, too,
when preparing to transfer it to the AmigoSounds AMS window (see next section)
using the <i><a href="#Console">Console Buttons</a></i>.
<p>Use your keyboard's <b>up</b> and <b>down arrow keys</b> or click and
drag the associated <b>scroll bar</b> to scroll the list of sounds.
<h2>
<a NAME="AMS"></a>AMS Window, Load AMS, &amp; Play Sound</h2>
AmigoSounds' AMS Window contains the list of System and User sounds that
comprise the <i>Activ</i>Media Sound file (AMS) that you are assembling
and editing for eventual download to your Amigo<font size=-1>BOT.</font>
Use the File
<i><a href="File.html#Open">Open</a></i> option or <b>Load
AMS</b> button to enable a file selection dialog from which you load a
previously assembled ".ams" file from disk. Or select
<i><a href="File.html#New">New</a></i>
from the <b>File</b> menu to start a brand new AMS.
<ul>
<li>
<b>System Sounds</b> are the 50 total sounds that AmigoBot
automatically plays in response to certain system-related conditions and
events, such as when the batteries are low or when its microcontroller
gets reset. In the AMS window, a description of the system condition or
event appears in parentheses next to the System Sounds name, if one is
specified.</li>

<li>
<b>User Sounds</b> are those that the user may have AmigoBot
play at any time through a controlling program such as Navigator or WorldPass.
Amigo<font size=-1>BOT </font>holds up to 200 User Sounds.</li>

<li>
<b>User Sound Groups</b> organize the various User Sounds to help you quickly
find an appropriate sound.</li>
</ul>
Click a <b>System</b> or <b>User</b> sound name to select it in the AMS
list, then click the <b>Play Sound</b> button beneath the Sounds window
to hear the sound reproduced through your PC audio system (sound card required
for this operation).
<p>Use your keyboard <b>up</b> and <b>down arrow keys</b> or click and
drag the associated <b>scroll bar</b> to scroll the list of AMS sounds
in the Sounds window.
<h2>
<a NAME="Console"></a>Center Console Buttons</h2>
A collection of buttons in AmigoSounds' center console let you exchange
sounds and edit the AMS between the Sound Files and AMS windows. A sound
may be added more than once to the AMS. Redundant entries do not increase
the size of the AMS since the sound data is not added, but simply referenced
for each addition--<b><i>but only for the current session</i></b>. Reloaded
AMS files cannot distinguish previously used sound names, so new entries
will increase the size of the AMS, even if&nbsp; the same sound was added
in a previous session.
<p>Console operations typically require that you click a sound in either
or both the Sound Files and AMS windows. The former selection is in preparation
for addition of the sound to the AMS. How the selected sound name in the
Sounds window is treated depends on the operation:
<ul>
<li>
The <b>Right Arrow </b>button converts an original sound file selected in
the Sound Files window into a sound in the AMS window. The entry is made
differently depending where you have selected a position in the AMS window:</li>

<ul>
<li>
If you have highlighted a <b>System</b> sound name, the transferred sound
<i>replaces</i>
the System sound or just fills the empty slot.</li>

<li>
Added <b>User</b> sounds appear below the selected sound or group name.
Highlight the <b>User Sounds</b> title, for instance, to add sounds to
the top of the User Sounds list.</li>

<li>
If no System or User sound is selected, added sounds go on the end of the
User Sounds list.</li>
</ul>

<li>
The <b>Up and Down Arrow </b>buttons are for AMS sounds only and move the
selected sound or group name up or down the AMS list. Sounds cannot be
moved in position from System to User Sounds.</li>

<li>
Use the <b>Left Arrow</b> console button to convert and transfer an AMS
sound into your <b>Sound Files</b> window and disk directory. This is a
convenient way to exchange AMS sounds among shared sound files where you
don't have a copy of the original sound. <b><i>Available only with the
Linux version of AmigoSounds.</i></b></li>

<li>
Click <b>Remove</b> to delete the selected sound name and its associated
sound data from the AMS. Notice that the <i><a href="#Available">Available
Time</a></i> should increase if the sound is not duplicated elsewhere in
the list. <b>Careful:</b> you can't undo Remove. Consider transferring
the sound to the Sound Files directory first (Left Arrow above), or identify
a copy of the original sound.</li>

<li>
<b>New Group</b> opens a text input dialog and inserts your typed Group
name in all capital letters just after a selected User Sound or at the
end of the AMS if you hadn't selected a User sound. Groups don't take up
<i><a href="#Available">Available
Time</a></i> or space, but are moved and removed like actual sounds. Groups
do use up one of the total 200 User Sound references.</li>

<li>
<b>New AMS</b>, <b>Open AMS</b>, and <b>Save AMS</b> are alternative ways
to start a new AMS, load one for editing, and to save the current file
to disk, respectively. See their <i><a href="File.html">File</a></i> menu
counterparts for details.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
<a NAME="Download"></a>Download</h2>
Like the <b>File</b> menu's <i><a href="File.html#Download">Download</a></i>
option, the <b>Download</b> button at the bottom of the AmigoSounds window
starts the process of transferring the AMS you have <i><a href="#Sound_in">loaded</a></i>
with contents displayed in the <i><a href="#AMS">AMS Window</a></i> to
an Amigo<font size=-1>BOT'</font>s onboard sound system.
<p>Prepare before downloading:
<ul>
<li>
Attach an AmigoLeash between a serial port on your PC and the System Serial
Port on the underside of your AmigoBot next to the
Main Power switch.</li>

<li>
Start up AmigoBot and put it into <b>System Mode:</b></li>

<ul>
<li>
Press and hold in the black <b>Motors/Self-Test</b> pushbutton</li>

<li>
Press and release the red <b>Reset</b> pushbutton</li>

<li>
Release the black <b>Motors/Self-Test</b> pushbutton.</li>
</ul>

<li>
In System Mode, your AmigoBot's amber and red LEDs
are lit continuously, and the green LED flashes.</li>
</ul>
If you have not previously selected the serial port on your PC to which
you have attached the AmigoLeash, a dialog box will appear asking you to
select the appropriate port name: COM1-4 for Windows9x/NT(R), or ttyS0-3
for Linux users, respectively.
<p>Be patient: a typical download lasts more than 10 minutes, during which
a thermometer-like bar indicates the download's progress. Interrupted sound
downloads may produce some hideous sounds, but will not otherwise harm
the operation or performance of your AmigoBot.
