<h2>
<a NAME="New"></a><u>N</u>ew</h2>
Clears the current AMS window in preparation for an entirely new ActivMedia
Sound file (AMS). You'll be asked to <i><a href="#Save">Save</a></i> your
work if you had made any changes to the current AMS. If so, choose <b>Save</b>
in the Save File dialog to overwrite the original file (default) or type
in a new pathname to create a new AMS (the ".ams" filename suffix is added
automatically to the filename if you don't include it). Choose <b>Cancel</b>
in the dialog to retain the original AMS on disk, ignoring any edits you
may have made to it in the Sounds window, and enabling a fresh (clear)
Sounds window.
<h2>
<a NAME="Open"></a><u>O</u>pen</h2>
Same as the <i>Load AMS</i> button on the AmigoSounds console, <b>Open</b>
lets you select and load an ActivMedia Sound file into the AMS window for
editing and eventual download to AmigoBot.
<p>You'll be asked to <i><a href="#Save">Save</a></i> your previous work
if you had made any changes to the current AMS. If so, choose <b>Save</b>
in the dialog to overwrite the original file (default); if it's a <i><a href="#New">New</a></i>
AMS, you'll be asked to type in a pathname to create a new ".ams" sound
file. Choose <b>Cancel</b> in the dialog to retain the original file on
disk, ignoring any edits you may have made to it in the AMS window.
<p><b>Open</b> starts a file selection dialog from which you select an
AMS from the default ActivMedia Sounds directory or elsewhere. Choose
<b>Okay</b>
to load the selected file into the AMS window, or <b>Cancel</b> to ignore
the selection and retain the current sound file.
<h2>
<a NAME="Close"></a><u>C</u>lose</h2>
Same as <i><a href="#New">New</a></i>.
<h2>
<a NAME="Save"></a><u>S</u>ave</h2>
Saves the sound file you've assembled and edited in the AMS window to a
permanent file in your chosen AMS directory on disk. The <b>Save As...</b>
dialog will appear asking you for a directory path and filename if it's
a <i><a href="#New">New</a></i> AMS. Otherwise, this operation automatically
overwrites the <b>Opened</b> AMS with the sounds as it appears in the AMS
window.
<h2>
<a NAME="Save As"></a>Save <u>A</u>s...</h2>
Enables a dialog in which you specify a name and target directory for saving
the AMS that you have assembled and edited in the AMS window. Note that
the filename suffix ".ams" automatically gets appended to the given filename,
if you don't add it to the name yourself.
<h2>
<a NAME="Download"></a><u>D</u>ownload to AmigoBot</h2>
Downloads the current AMS to your AmigoBot. See a description of the <i><a href="MainWindow.html#Download">Download</a></i>
console button for details.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Choose Sounds"></a>C<u>h</u>oose Sounds Directory</h2>
Opens a dialog from which you select the directory on one of your disks
where you store the sound recordings (".wav", ".au", and other sound files)
for addition to the current AMS in the Sounds window. The various sound
filenames appear in AmigoSounds' <b>Sound Files</b> window.
<p>If you have enabled <i><a href="Settings.html#Lengths">Show Sound Lengths</a></i>
in your <i><a href="Settings.html#Preferences">Preferences</a></i>, AmigoSounds
will take several moments to calculate and display the length of time in
seconds for each sound in the adjacent <i>Length</i> window. Please be
patient.
<center>
<p><b><u><font size=+1>CAUTION:</font></u></b></center>

<p>Occasionally, the Microsoft Windows(R) version of the accessory program
SOX, will cause an error by performing an "illegal operation" when calculating
length and time for some sounds. Please <b>Close</b> the error notice.
AmigoSounds also will notify you that an error happened, but it's usually
safe to continue. We apologize for the inconvenience, but such errors currently
are unavoidable.
<br>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<h2>
<a NAME="Quit"></a><u>Q</u>uit</h2>
Same as the <b>Close Box</b> in the upper right corner of the main window.
You'll be asked to <i><a href="#Save">Save</a></i> your work, if you had
made any changes to the current AMS window. If so, choose <b>Save</b> in
the dialog to overwrite the original file (default) or, if it's a <i><a href="#New">New</a></i>
AMS, you'll be asked to type in a new pathname to create a new ".ams" sound
file. Choose <b>Cancel</b> in the dialog to retain the original file on
disk, ignoring any edits you may have made in the AMS window.
<p>You'll also be asked if you want to "Really quit?" Choose <b>Yes</b>
to shut down AmigoSounds and closes all accessory files and programs. <b>No</b>
resumes the program where you left off.
